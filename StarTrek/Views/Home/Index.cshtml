            <p class="test">This was a passion project from the mind of Marisa Edgar and codeveloped by Isaac Overstreet, Chase Stokes, Mikah Mathews and Zachary Green. We set out to create a comprehensive database that fans of the series could use to find out info about characters and timeline events from the span of the series. This project showcases the power of using .Net Core API software to easily incorporate information stored in a database, into an MVC application. The curious Science Officer will find many fantastical adventures underneath the hood of this project and we encourage you to check out the repo.</p>
